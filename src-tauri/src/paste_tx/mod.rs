//! Receipt-sequenced clipboard paste ("reliable paste", debug-gated).
//!
//! The legacy clipboard paste (`clipboard::paste_via_clipboard`) restores the
//! previous clipboard after a fixed delay. The paste keystroke is only
//! *enqueued* at that point — the target application reads the clipboard
//! whenever its event loop gets to it, so any fixed delay can lose the race
//! and the user gets their old clipboard pasted back (#502).
//!
//! This module instead publishes the transcript as a *lazy promise* and waits
//! for the operating system to tell us that a consumer actually read the
//! clipboard — a "receipt" — before restoring:
//!
//! - macOS: `declareTypes:owner:` with an owner object, the pasteboard calls
//!   `pasteboard:provideDataForType:` on read.
//! - Windows: delayed rendering (`SetClipboardData(CF_UNICODETEXT, NULL)`),
//!   the owner window receives `WM_RENDERFORMAT` on read. Skeleton only for
//!   now; the caller falls back to the legacy path.
//!
//! Two rules make the receipt trustworthy:
//!
//! 1. Only receipts observed *after* the paste chord was injected count. A
//!    read before that is an eager third party (clipboard manager, antivirus)
//!    reacting to the clipboard change itself.
//! 2. Restoration only happens while we still own the clipboard
//!    (sequence number / changeCount unchanged, no ownership-lost event). If
//!    the user copied something else in the meantime, their action wins.
//!
//! The restore is additionally gated on a short quiet period after the *last*
//! receipt, because some applications read the clipboard several times per
//! paste (Chromium probes, then reads). A bounded timeout caps how long the
//! transcript may occupy the clipboard; the failure mode is always "the
//! transcript stays on the clipboard a bit longer", never "stale content gets
//! pasted".

// The shared transaction state is compiled on all platforms (for the unit
// tests), but only the macOS/Windows platform modules consume all of it.
